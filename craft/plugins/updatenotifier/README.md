## Installation

To install UpdateNotifier, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `updatenotifier` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/billythekid/updatenotifier.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require billythekid/updatenotifier`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
